Docker Container build and deploy:
Prequisties:
Docker installed on windows or linux


Dockerfile,requirements.txt and app.py, put them in the same folder . This completes our app, which as you can see is quite simple. When the above Dockerfile is built into an image, app.py and requirements.txt is present because of that Dockerfileâ€™s COPY command, 
and the output from app.py is accessible over HTTP 

#Use below command to build the file which creates a Docker image
docker build --tag=hex_rgb 

#Now run the image using below command
docker run -p 4000:80 hex_rgb
